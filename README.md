# Hopfield Network for Pattern Restoration


## Methodology
- **Pattern Generation:** Created random binary patterns to serve as reference patterns for the Hopfield network.
  
- **Pattern Perturbation:** Introduced noise by flipping bits in patterns to simulate real-world scenarios with imperfect inputs.
  
- **Network Dynamics:** Updated the network state iteratively to observe the restoration of original patterns from noisy inputs, demonstrating the network's recovery capabilities.

## Results
- **Pattern Restoration:** Successfully demonstrated the network’s ability to restore original patterns from noisy versions, highlighting its resilience to input noise.
  
- **Visualization of Dynamics:** Visualized the network’s convergence behavior, showing the recovery of the stored pattern over iterations, confirming the effectiveness of the Hopfield network.
